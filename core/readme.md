# @pycheevos/core

The Core module is the engine of PyCheevos. It handles memory addressing, variable types, arithmetic operations, and condition generation.

While `models` (Achievement, Set) handle the "structure", `core` handles the "logic".

### 1. **Memory Helpers**

Located in `core.helpers`, these functions are the primary way to define memory addresses. You generally do not need to import `MemoryValue` directly.

#### **Accessing Raw Address**
Sometimes you may need the integer value of the address back (e.g., for meta-programming or loops). You can use the `.raw_address` property on static memory objects.

```python
mem = byte(0x1234)
print(mem.raw_address)  # Output: 4660 (0x1234)
```

**Note**: Accessing `.raw_address` on a pointer chain or complex expression (like `base >> offset`) will raise an error, as those do not have a single static address.

#### **Standard Sizes**

| function | size | RA Syntax | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `byte(addr)` | 8-bit | `0xh...` | `byte(0x100)` |
| `word(addr)` | 16-bit | `0x ...` | `word(0x100)` |
| `dword(addr)` | 32-bit | `0xX...` | `dword(0x100)` |

#### **Bits & Nibbles**

| function | Description | RA Syntax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bit0(addr)`...`bit7(addr)` | Single Bit access | `0xM...` to `0xT...` |
| `lower(addr)` | Lower 4 bits (Nibble) | `0xL...` |
| `high4(addr)` | Upper 4 bits (Nibble) | `0xU...` |

#### **Floating Point**

| function | Description | RA Syntax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `float32(addr)` | 32-bit Float | `fF...` |
| `float32be(addr)` | 32-bit Float (Big Endian) | `fB...` |
| `double32(addr)` | 32-bit Double | `fH...` |
| `mbf32(addr)` | Microsoft Binary Format | `fM...` |

#### **Usage Example**:

```python
from core.helpers import byte, word, bit0

level_id = byte(0x00A1)
timer = word(0x00B0)
is_active = bit0(0x00F0)
```
---
### 2. **Constants & Safety**

#### **The `value()` Helper**

Python evaluates mathematical comparisons immediately (`0 == 0` becomes `True`). To treat constant numbers as Logic Objects (so they can accept flags or be part of a generated condition), use `value()`.

```python
from core.helpers import value, measured

# BAD: Python calculates this as False, logic is lost
# (0 == 1).with_flag(measured)

# GOOD: PyCheevos treats this as a Condition object
(value(0) == value(1)).with_flag(measured)

# Comparison with memory
# Equivalent to: byte(0x1234) > 10
byte(0x1234) > value(10) 
```
---
### 3. **Value Modifiers**

These functions transform how the emulator reads a value relative to the previous frame.

`delta(memory)`

Returns the value the memory had in the **previous frame**.

* **Use case**: Checking for the exact frame a value changes such as a level ID changing from level 1 to level 2.
* **Example**: `level_id != delta(level_id)` (Level ID changed).

`prior(memory)`

Returns the previous value of the address **regardless of the number of frames since changing value**.

* **Use case**: Checking that a user accessed a level through the proper means and not through a password on the main menu.
* **Example**: `prior(level_id != 0)`

`bcd(memory)`

Interprets the memory value as Binary-Coded Decimal.

* **Use case**: Games that store "10" lives as `0x10` instead of `0x0A`.

`invert(memory)`

Returns the bitwise inversion of the value (`~`).

#### **Usage Example**:

```python
from core.helpers import byte, prior, bcd

lives = byte(0x1234)

# Check if lives decreased
lost_life = lives < prior(lives)

# Compare BCD value
has_10_lives = bcd(lives) == 10
```
---
### 4. Arithmetic & Pointers

The `MemoryValue` objects support standard Python math operators. These are compiled into `AddSource` and `SubSource` chains.

#### **Basic Math**

You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide memory addresses and constants.

```python
# Logic: (0xH100 + 0xH200) > 50
total_ammo = byte(0x100) + byte(0x200)
condition = (total_ammo > 50)
```

#### **Pointer Chains** (`>>`)

The right-shift operator (`>>`) is overloaded to handle **AddAddress** logic (pointers). It reads the value on the left, adds it as an offset to the value on the right.

* **Syntax**: `Base >> Offset`
* **RA Logic**: `I:Base_Offset`

```python
player_base = dword(0x0800)
offset_hp   = byte(0x0040)

# Read [PlayerBase] + 0x40
current_hp = (player_base >> offset_hp)
```
---
### 5. **Bitwise Operations (Memory)**

You can perform bitwise logic between memory addresses or constants.

| Operator | Description | RA Operator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `&` | 	Bitwise AND	 | `&` |
| `^` | 	Bitwise XOR	 | `^` |
| `*` | 	Multiply	 | `*` |
| `/` | 	Divide	 | `/` |
| `%` | 	Modulo	 | `%` |

```python
flags = byte(0x5000)

# Check if flags has bits 0x03 (0000 0011) set
masked = (flags & 0x03)
is_active = (masked == 0x03)
```
---
### 6. **Conditions, Flags & Logic**

A `Condition` is generated when you compare a `MemoryValue` (e.g., `==`, `>`, `<=`). You can attach special behaviors to these conditions.

#### **Hit Counts (`.with_hits`)**

Requires the condition to be true `count` times for the achievement to trigger.

```python
# Trigger only after being in this state for 60 frames (1 second)
(state == 1).with_hits(60)
```

#### **Applying Flags (`.with_flag`)**

You can apply flags like `ResetIf`, `PauseIf`, or `Remember` directly to memory addresses, pointer expressions, or comparisons.

**Available flags** (imported from `core.constants`):

* `reset_if` / `Flag.RESET_IF`: Resets the achievement progress if true.
* `pause_if` / `Flag.PAUSE_IF`: Pauses hit counting if true.
* `trigger` / `Flag.TRIGGER`: Explicit trigger condition.
* `measured` / `Flag.MEASURED`: Shows a progress bar in the overlay.
* `remember` / `Flag.REMEMBER`: Stores the value for `recall()`.

#### **Logical Operators (Chain)**

You can chain conditions using standard Python bitwise operators. This automatically generates `AND_NEXT` and `OR_NEXT` flags.

| Operator | Symbol | RA Flag | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AND** | `&` | `AND_NEXT` | All conditions must be true. |
| **OR** | `|` | `OR_NEXT` |
| **NOT** | `~` | N/A | Inverts the comparison (`==` -> `!=`) and logic. |

#### **Usage Examples**:

```python
from core.constants import reset_if, measured, remember

# 1. On a comparison (Standard)
# Reset if player dies (Lives < Previous Lives)
(lives < prior(lives)).with_flag(reset_if)

# 2. Logic Chaining (New!)
# (Is In Game) AND (Level Is 1)
is_ingame = (byte(0x10) == 1)
level_one = (byte(0x20) == 1)

logic = is_ingame & level_one

# 3. Complex Logic
# NOT (Pause) AND (Health > 0)
(~pause_active) & (health > 0)
```

### 7. **Remember & Recall**

This system allows you to store a memory value and compare it against itself later in the same frame evaluation.

1. **Remember**: Use `.with_flag(Flag.REMEMBER)` on a condition (usually `addr`) to store its value.
2. **Recall**: Use `recall()` helper to access that stored value.

#### **Example: Check if Ammo increased by exactly 5**

```python
from core.helpers import recall
from core.constants import Flag

# 1. Store 'Ammo' into the Recall buffer
store = Condition(mem_ammo).with_flag(Flag.REMEMBER)

# 2. Check if Current Ammo == Stored Ammo + 5
check = (mem_ammo == recall() + 5)

achievement.add_core([store, check])
```

Logic generated: `K:0xH1234_0xH1234={recall}+5`
